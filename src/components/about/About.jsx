          <p>
          Our first step was to research on the area occupied by the tourist spot.We approached the Trust of Sri Gayatri Tapobhoomi and explained to them about the activities that we wanted to conduct. We selected the above dates and gave them our schedule for the following Activities. We then surveyed the Temple premises. We got to know from the Temple Trust members that the average area occupied by the temple is around 8,240 square meters. 
At a distance of 24 km from Hubli, Gayatri Tapovan is a spiritual institute and a temple located at Ramankop village near Hubli, Karnataka. It is one of the popular places of pilgrimage in Hubli, and among the must-visit places as part of the Hubli Tour.

     <h2>Estimation of total investment</h2>

         <p className='paragraph'>
         We then got the information about what are the investments and areas of investments of the Temple. Most ancient stone temples were the results of royal patronage and built to benefit whole community, they were expressions of devotion and piety of the ruler and his people. 
The temples were maintained through donations from patrons and private individuals. They were given money, livestock, income from grants of land…etc.
The total investment of the Gayatri Tapobhoomi is estimated to be somewhere near 2 lakhs.

          <p>
          We talked with the Temple Trust members about the various construction material used in construction of the temple.We also enquired about the construction method used in building the temple.
In short, this temple was built by quarrying and sculpting huge stones often granites with huge manpower and animal power for logistics and building.
Earlier, temples were built with clay with thatched roofs made of straws or leaves. But later, temples were built using bricks, stones, in various styles like Dravidian style, Chola style, Chalukya style…etc. 
The temple has a square plan architecture with four entrances from the cardinal directions, while illustrating the sandhara plan found in Sanskrit texts on architecture. 
Gayatri Tapobhoomi is a monument from the Kalyana era. It lacks a foundation inscription, and its date thus has to be indirectly inferred by other inscriptions that mention it, architectural style and iconographic details.
The outer walls include the architectural and decorative details in major Hindu temples, but to accommodate the four entrances, the temple integrates ardha-mandapas that function as antaralas.
The outer walls of the temple have niches framed with pilasters. These depict a galaxy of deities and Hindu legends from all the major traditions within Hinduism: Brahma, avatars of Vishnu, and various forms of Siva. Of particular note are the Nataraja, dancing Ganesha, Sarasvati.

     <h2>Why the specific method of construction is used?</h2>

     <div className="container about__container">
       

         <p className='paragraph'>
         Though the basic plan of the Western Chalukya style originated from the older dravida style, many of its features were unique and peculiar to it. One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an articulation that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only exceptions to this motif can be found in the area around Kalyani, where the temples exhibit a nagara (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character. The basic floor plan is defined by the size of the shrine, the size of the sanctum, the distribution of the building mass, and by the pradakshina (path for circumambulation), if there is one.The pillars that support the roof of the mantapa are monolithic shafts from the base up to the neck of the capital. Therefore, the height of the mantapa and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries.[30] The height of the temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material. 
The absence of mortar allows some ventilation in the innermost parts of the temple through the porous masonry used in the walls and ceilings. The modest amount of light entering the temples comes into the open halls from all directions, while the very subdued illumination in the inner closed mantapa comes only through its open doorway. The vestibule receives even less light, making it necessary to have lit oil lamps even during the day. This artificial source of light perhaps adds "mystery" to the image of the deity worshipped in the sanctum.

          <p>
          The next step was to an outline of spots in the temple premises.
There is a central, main Temple in which Goddess Gayatri Devi is seated. At the left and right of the Main Temple is the smaller temples which house Shri Krishnendra Guru and Shri Satya Datta.

Behind the Main Temple is the Gnyana Ganapathi temple which houses Gnyana Ganapathi.
